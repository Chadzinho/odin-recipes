    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A light and fluffy crust, sweet tomatoes and bubbly mozzarella garnished with fragrant basil. That’s all you need for a classic Margherita pizza - the perfect place to start on your journey in home pizza-making - as well as a tested-and-true recipe for when you’re looking to serve up something tasty and timeless</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>250 (or 330) grams of Classic Pizza Dough</li>
       <li>Flour, for dusting</li>
       <li>80 grams crushed tomatoes</li>
       <li>100 grams fresh mozzarella, torn into pieces</li>
       <li>5 grams extra-virgin olive oil</li>
       <li>Handful of basil leaves</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fire up your oven. Aim for  500 ˚C (930 ˚F) on the stone baking board inside. You can check the temperature inside your oven quickly and easily using an infrared thermometer.</li>
        <li>Using a small amount of flour, dust your work surface and your pizza peel. </li>
        <li>Stretch the pizza dough ball out to 12 or 16 inches (30 or 41 centimetres) and lay it out on your pizza peel. </li>
        <li>Top with sauce, followed by the mozzarella and olive oil, spreading both evenly on the dough and leaving room for the cornicione, or crust (about a ½ inch or 1 centimetre)</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza off the peel and into your oven and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, making sure to rotate the pizza every 20 seconds for an even bake.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the pizza from the oven and top with whole, fresh basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Slice, serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
