    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix</strong> plain yogurt, garlic, ginger, garam masala, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, and salt and chicken pieces (thighs or breasts) and mix so it’s coated evenly. Allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the fridge for deeper flavor).</li>
        <li><strong>The Chicken</strong>: Heat a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat and add a small amount of oil. Cook the marinated chicken in batches, searing until browned on all sides, Then set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce</strong>: In the same skillet, melt butter and sauté onions until softened. Add garlic, ginger, and remaining spices (garam masala, cumin, chili powder) and cook until fragrant. Stir in crushed tomatoes, bringing the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend and Thicken the Sauce</strong>: Use an immersion blender to blend the sauce until smooth (or transfer to a blender). Return the sauce to the skillet, add cream, and stir well. Adjust seasoning with salt and sugar to balance flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer</strong>: Add the seared chicken back into the sauce and simmer until cooked through and thickened, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish</strong>: sprinkle fresh cilantro and serve with rice or garlic naan.</li>
    </ol>
